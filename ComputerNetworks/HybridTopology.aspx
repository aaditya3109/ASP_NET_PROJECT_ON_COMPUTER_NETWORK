                   Hybrid topology is combination of two or more different topologies (bus, star, ring, etc.).
                    The hybrid network is based on both peer-to-peer and client-server relationship.
           When two different basic network topologies are connected then it formed the hybrid topology.
                    Hybrid topology can be wired or wireless.
                    The hybrid network allows the network administrator to provide the stability and speed of the data connection or bandwidth. 
                   The security risk is very low in the hybrid network, so when user send the data to other systems of other networks (except star network) then there are very fewer chances to show data to other
                    users because of control on the network by network administrator node.
                    This network also provides greater flexibility, where lots of computers are capable of connecting to the Internet.

                   <strong>Advantages of Hybrid Topology</strong><br />
                  * Very reliable and easy to detect the Faulty system.<br />
* Troubleshooting is easy.<br />
* It includes both wired and wireless network.<br />
* It is an expandable network.<br />
                   <strong>Disadvantages of Hybrid Topology</strong><br />
                   * Its design is difficult to understand.<br />
* The cost of this network design is high, because of the requirement of a lot of cables, cooling systems, etc.<br />
* MAU ( Multi-station Access Unit) is required.<br />
