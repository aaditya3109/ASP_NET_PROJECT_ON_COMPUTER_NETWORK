                    A Star network is one of the most common computer network topologies. In its simplest form, a star network consists of one central hub which acts as a conduit to transmit messages. In star topology, every host is connected to a central hub. A star network is an implementation of a spoke–hub distribution paradigm in computer networks.

The hub and hosts, and the transmission lines between them, form a graph with the topology of a star. Data on a star network passes through the hub before continuing to its destination. The hub manages and controls all functions of the network. It also acts as a repeater for the data flow.
                <br /><strong>Advantages of Star topology</strong><br />
* If one node or its connection breaks, it doesn’t affect the other computers nor their connections.<br />
* Devices can be added or removed without disturbing the network
              <br /><strong>Disadvantages of Star topology</strong><br />
* An expensive network layout to install because of the number and length of cables needed to wire each host to the central hub.<br />
* The central hub is a single point of failure for the network
